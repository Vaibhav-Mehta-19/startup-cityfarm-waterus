# startup-cityfarm-waterus-

Project descriptionIt is my start-up product aiming at solving two of the major problems in the field of agriculture, one being the manual irrigation process leading to physical and mental stress in farmers and the other being the involvement of intermediaries in the process of selling of crops. The CityFarm is a website and an android-based application that connects the farmers directly to the customers thus providing the farmers with better prices for their crops and the customers would get better direct farm quality product. WaterUS is an IOT based device that will be used to automate the process of irrigation in the fields. It will be smart and will be measuring different parameters like temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc. to calculate the correct amount of water needed for a particular crop on a particular day thus preventing physical stress in farmers and saving a lot of water.
